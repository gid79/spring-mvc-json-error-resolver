This is a simple Spring MVC 3.0.5 web application to demonstrate an issue using @ResponseStatus(reason = 'Message')

Usage:

> mvn tomcat:run

> curl -v http://localhost:8080/404

> curl -v http://localhost:8080/404b

both requests are implemented to throw an exception, but the /404b request is handled by a method annotated with the 'reason' attribute.
